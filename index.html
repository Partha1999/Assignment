            <h1>Food for a family</h1>
            <p>While financial contributions are most effective, <br>
              “if what people can give is food, then give that food.<br>
               Because that is always appreciated,” Fitzgerald says. <br>
              Think shelf-stable dried and canned goods—pantry staples like beans,<br>
               rice, pasta, soup, peanut butter, cereal—that you buy at the store .

            <h1>Education for a child</h1>
            <p>Education is the birthright of every child. <br>
              There are many reasons why education is vital for children. <br>
              It develops wisdom and intelligence which help in being self-dependent<br>
               in life. <br>
              It plays a vital role in the development of personality.
